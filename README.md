# 🚀 Beginner ETL Pipeline: Crypto Market Data

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates a **beginner-friendly ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline** for fetching cryptocurrency market data from the **CoinGecko API**, transforming it into a simplified dataset, and loading it into a **PostgreSQL** database.

The aim is to simulate a real-world **Data Engineering workflow** and practice:
- API data extraction
- Data transformation with Pandas
- Data loading into relational databases
- Logging for monitoring ETL jobs
